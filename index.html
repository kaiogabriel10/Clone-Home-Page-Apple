        <p>1. Offer valid on qualifying purchases of eligible Apple products from November 25, 2022, to November 28, 2022, at a qualifying location. Offer subject to availability. While supplies last. Customers shall receive a discount equal to the value of the Promotion Product (depending on their purchase) off the price of the Eligible Product, but will be charged for all items in their cart. Important notice regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement for Apple Card Monthly Installment (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: A purchase of an Eligible Product made when selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option available only in the U.S.) as the payment type at checkout will receive an instant credit equal to the cost of the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) deducted from the price of the Eligible Product at the time of purchase. You will be charged one ACMI installment plan for the Eligible Product discounted by the instant credit. The value of the Promotion Product (i.e. the value of the Apple Gift Card) will also be charged in a separate second ACMI installment plan for the same number of months as the discounted Eligible Product. The total combined amount charged over the 2 separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the original full retail price of the Eligible Product. Separately, you will receive and be charged for the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) in the amount of the applicable instant credit. ACMI is subject to credit approval and credit limit. Variable APRs for Apple Card other than ACMI range from 13.99% to 24.99% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of October 1, 2022. If you choose the pay-in-full or one-time-payment option for an ACMI-eligible purchase instead of choosing ACMI as the payment option at checkout, that purchase will be subject to the variable APR assigned to your Apple Card. Taxes and shipping are not included in ACMI transactions and are subject to your standard purchase APR. See the Apple Card Customer Agreement at https://www.goldmansachs.com/terms-and-conditions/Apple-Card-Customer-Agreement.pdf for more information. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at the following special stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government, and Veterans and Military Purchase Programs, or on refurbished devices. iPhone activation required on iPhone purchases made at an Apple Store with one of these national carriers: AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, or T-Mobile.
